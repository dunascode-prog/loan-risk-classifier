🏦 **Loan Risk Prediction (ML Project)**

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to **default** or not, based on demographic, financial, and credit history features.  

**It demonstrates the **end-to-end ML workflow**:**
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- 🧮 Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- ✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix)
- 💾 Exporting results to `loan_results.csv`

⚡ **Note**: This project is still in development and will be expanded soon with additional models, improved visualizations, and deployment features.

## 🚀 Features
- Encodes categorical features with `pd.get_dummies`
- Scales numerical data with `StandardScaler`
- Trains and tunes a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model
- Evaluates performance with multiple metrics
- Saves predictions + probabilities to `loan_results.csv`
